# Website for the Astro Group @ UNSW Canberra.

Based on the **[Moon](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon)** jekyll theme, customized and adapted by [Nicolas Rodriguez-Segovia](https://nrsegovia.github.io).

## How to add new members

Copy the template in `_posts/members` and rename it by following the format of other profile pages in the same directory. Be sure to set `faculty` or `postgrad` properly, so it shows up on the right place afterwards.

## How to add news

Just copy the latest entry in `_posts/news` and modify the contents.

## Formatting and design

This theme supports both markdown and html, so you can play around with those.
