## Research Opportunities

Graduate research projects under my supervision at UNSW Canberra include research topics in both theoretical and observational astrophysics. Experience in computer programming (e.g. C, python) is an asset. Prospective PhD students with high academic standing or a Masters by Research can apply to receive a UNSW- or Government-funded scholarship (one of which is required to undertake graduate studies in our group).
