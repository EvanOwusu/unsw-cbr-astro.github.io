## About
<img src="/assets/img/IvoSeitenzahl.jpg" style="float: left; border-radius: 50%; width: 33%; margin-right: 15px" />
In 2017 I was awarded a Future Fellowship by the Australian Research Council in the School of Science at the University of New South Wales Canberra. I’m working on models and simulations of thermonuclear supernova explosions and their associated nucleosynthesis

I am editor-in-chief for the Cambridge University Press journal PASA (Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia, 2021 Impact Factor: 6.51) and on the steering committee for ANITA (Australian National Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics).

From April 2014 - April 2017 I was a SkyMapper research fellow at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (Mount Stromlo) in the group of Brian Schmidt at the Australian National University. 
Before that, I was an Emmy Noether postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in the supernova group of Friedrich Röpke in Garching, Germany (Sep 2008 - Jun 2011) and a postdoctoral researcher at the Graduate School of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics at the Universität Würzburg in Germany (Jun 2011 - Dec 2013).
I received my PhD in 2008 from The University of Chicago, under the supervision of Prof James Truran. I spent 5 months of my PhD as a Marie Curie Fellow at the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas (ECT*).


I have three Bachelor of Science degrees (astronomy, mathematics, physics) from the University of Arizona in Tucson (1998), where I received the honours of Senior of the Year in both the department of physics and the department of mathematics.

## Research Opportunities
Graduate research projects under my supervision at UNSW Canberra include research topics in both theoretical and observational astrophysics. Experience in computer programming (e.g. C, python) is an asset. Prospective PhD students with high academic standing or a Masters by Research can apply to receive a UNSW- or Government-funded scholarship (one of which is required to undertake graduate studies in our group).
